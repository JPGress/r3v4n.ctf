I Summary
=========

This document reports on the results of an automatic security scan.
The report first summarises the results found.
Then, for each host, the report describes every issue found.
Please consider the advice given in each description, in order to rectify
the issue.

All dates are displayed using the timezone "America/Sao_Paulo",
which is abbreviated "-03".

Vendor security updates are not trusted.

Overrides are off.  Even when a result has an override, this report uses
the actual threat of the result.

Notes are included in the report.Information on overrides is included in the report.

This report might not show details of all issues that were found.
Issues with the threat level "Log" are not shown.
Issues with the threat level "Debug" are not shown.
Issues with the threat level "False Positive" are not shown.
Only results with a minimum QoD of 70 are shown.

This report contains result 1 of the 1 results selected by the
filtering above.  Before filtering there were 83 results.

Security Issues for Host 10.0.0.30
----------------------------------

Issue
-----
NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 2102538062
Packet 2: 2102539150

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

TCP timestamps

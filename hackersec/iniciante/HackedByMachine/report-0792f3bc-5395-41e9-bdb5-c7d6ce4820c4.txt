Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.8)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
WordPress platforms use a parameter called `author'. This parameter
  accepts integer values and represents the `User ID' of users in the
  web site. For example: http://www.example.com/?author=1

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following user names were revealed in id range 1-25.
Discovered username 'hackersec' with id '1'

Impact:
These problems trigger the following attack vectors:
  1. The query response discloses whether the User ID is enabled.
  2. The query response leaks (by redirection) the User Name
  corresponding with that User ID.

Solution:
Solution type: WillNotFix
No known solution was made available for at least one year since the disclosure !
of this vulnerability.
  Likely none will be provided anymore. General solution options are to upgrade !
to a newer release, disable respective features, remove the
  product or replace the product by another one.

Vulnerability Insight:
The problems found are:
  1. User ID values are generated consecutively.
  2. When a valid User ID is found, WordPress redirects to a web page
  with the name of the author.

Impact:
An attacker could use this for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks,
  accessing sensible data and other attacks.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Replace the SSL/TLS certificate with one signed by a trusted
  CA.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
The script reads the certificate used by the target host and
  checks if it was signed by a known untrusted and/or dangerous CA.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103440
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.0)
Port:   443/tcp

Summary:
This routine reports all Weak SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted
  by a service.
  NOTE: No severity for SMTP services with 'Opportunistic TLS' and weak cipher s!
uites on port
  25/tcp is reported. If too strong cipher suites are configured for this servic!
e the alternative
  would be to fall back to an even more insecure cleartext communication.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.0 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.1 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.2 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
The configuration of this services should be changed so
  that it does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.
  Please see the references for more resources supporting you with this task.

Vulnerability Insight:
These rules are applied for the evaluation of the cryptographic
  strength:
  - RC4 is considered to be weak (CVE-2013-2566, CVE-2015-2808)
  - Ciphers using 64 bit or less are considered to be vulnerable to brute force !
methods
  and therefore considered as weak (CVE-2015-4000)
  - 1024 bit RSA authentication is considered to be insecure and therefore as we!
ak
  - Any cipher considered to be secure for only the next 10 years is considered !
as medium
  - Any other cipher is considered as strong

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient DH Group Strength Vulnerability
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.106223
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.0)
Port:   443/tcp

Summary:
The SSL/TLS service uses Diffie-Hellman groups with insufficient strength
  (key size < 2048).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Server Temporary Key Size: 1024 bits

Impact:
An attacker might be able to decrypt the SSL/TLS communication offline.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
Deploy (Ephemeral) Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) or use
  a 2048-bit or stronger Diffie-Hellman group (see the references).
  For Apache Web Servers:
  Beginning with version 2.4.7, mod_ssl will use DH parameters which include pri!
mes with lengths of more than 1024 bits.

Vulnerability Insight:
The Diffie-Hellman group are some big numbers that are used as base for
  the DH computations. They can be, and often are, fixed. The security of the fi!
nal secret depends on the size
  of these parameters. It was found that 512 and 768 bits to be weak, 1024 bits !
to be breakable by really
  powerful attackers like governments.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the DHE temporary public key size.

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Certificate Signed Using A Weak Signature Algorithm
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105880
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.0)
Port:   443/tcp

Summary:
The remote service is using a SSL/TLS certificate in the certificate chain that !
has been signed using a
  cryptographically weak hashing algorithm.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following certificates are part of the certificate chain but using insecure !
signature algorithms:
Subject:              CN=localhost,O=Apache Friends,L=Berlin,ST=Berlin,C=DE
Signature Algorithm:  md5WithRSAEncryption

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Servers that use SSL/TLS certificates signed with a weak SHA-1, MD5, MD4 or MD2 !
hashing algorithm will need to obtain new
  SHA-2 signed SSL/TLS certificates to avoid web browser SSL/TLS certificate war!
nings.

Vulnerability Insight:
The following hashing algorithms used for signing SSL/TLS certificates are consi!
dered cryptographically weak
  and not secure enough for ongoing use:
  - Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
  - Message Digest 5 (MD5)
  - Message Digest 4 (MD4)
  - Message Digest 2 (MD2)
  Beginning as late as January 2017 and as early as June 2016, browser developer!
s such as Microsoft and Google will begin warning users when visiting
  web sites that use SHA-1 signed Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates.
  NOTE: The script preference allows to set one or more custom SHA-1 fingerprint!
s of CA certificates which are trusted by this routine. The fingerprints
  needs to be passed comma-separated and case-insensitive:
  Fingerprint1
  or
  fingerprint1, Fingerprint2

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check which hashing algorithm was used to sign the remote SSL/TLS certificate.

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 867583944
Packet 2: 867585033

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.127014
Threat: High (CVSS: 8.8)
Port:   10000/tcp

Summary:
Webmin is prone to a privilege escalation vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 1.962
Fixed version:     1.994
Installation
path / port:       /

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Update to version 1.994 or later.

ile parameter.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if a vulnerable version is present on the target host.

Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.8)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
The remote web server supports the TRACE and/or TRACK
  methods. TRACE and TRACK are HTTP methods which are used to debug web server c!
onnections.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The web server has the following HTTP methods enabled: TRACE

Impact:
An attacker may use this flaw to trick your legitimate web
  users to give him their credentials.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the TRACE and TRACK methods in your web server
  configuration.
  Please see the manual of your web server or the references for more informatio!
n.

Affected Software/OS:
Web servers with enabled TRACE and/or TRACK methods.

Vulnerability Insight:
It has been shown that web servers supporting this methods
  are subject to cross-site-scripting attacks, dubbed XST for Cross-Site-Tracing!
, when used in
  conjunction with various weaknesses in browsers.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if HTTP methods such as TRACE and TRACK are
  enabled and can be used.

NVT:    Weak Key Exchange (KEX) Algorithm(s) Supported (SSH)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.150713
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.3)
Port:   22/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow / support weak key
  exchange (KEX) algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The remote SSH server supports the following weak KEX algorithm(s):
KEX algorithm                      | Reason
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
-----------
diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 | Using SHA-1
diffie-hellman-group1-sha1         | Using Oakley Group 2 (a 1024-bit MODP group!
) and SHA-1

Impact:
An attacker can quickly break individual connections.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the reported weak KEX algorithm(s)
  - 1024-bit MODP group / prime KEX algorithms:
  Alternatively use elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellmann in general, e.g. Curve 25519.

Vulnerability Insight:
- 1024-bit MODP group / prime KEX algorithms:
  Millions of HTTPS, SSH, and VPN servers all use the same prime numbers for Dif!
fie-Hellman key
  exchange. Practitioners believed this was safe as long as new key exchange mes!
sages were generated
  for every connection. However, the first step in the number field sieve-the mo!
st efficient
  algorithm for breaking a Diffie-Hellman connection-is dependent only on this p!
rime.
  A nation-state can break a 1024-bit prime.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the supported KEX algorithms of the remote SSH server.
  Currently weak KEX algorithms are defined as the following:
  - non-elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellmann (DH) KEX algorithms with 1024-bit MODP gr!
oup / prime
  - ephemerally generated key exchange groups uses SHA-1
  - using RSA 1024-bit modulus key

Summary:
This routine reports all Weak SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted

Vulnerability Detection Result:
'Weak' cipher suites accepted by this service via the TLSv1.2 protocol:
TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
The configuration of this services should be changed so
  that it does not accept the listed weak cipher suites anymore.

NVT:    Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108440
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.8)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
The host / application transmits sensitive information (username, passwords) in
  cleartext via HTTP.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following input fields where identified (URL:input name):
http://10.0.0.25/cms/includes/sidebar.php:user_password

Impact:
An attacker could use this situation to compromise or eavesdrop on the
  HTTP communication between the client and the server using a man-in-the-middle!
 attack to get access to
  sensitive data like usernames or passwords.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
Enforce the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.
  Additionally make sure the host / application is redirecting all users to the !
secured SSL/TLS connection before
  allowing to input sensitive data into the mentioned functions.

Affected Software/OS:
Hosts / applications which doesn t enforce the transmission of sensitive data vi!
a an
  encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Evaluate previous collected information and check if the host / application is n!
ot
  enforcing the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connecti!
on.
  The script is currently checking the following:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication (Basic Auth)
  - HTTP Forms (e.g. Login) with input field of type 'password'

NVT:    Weak Encryption Algorithm(s) Supported (SSH)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105611
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.3)
Port:   22/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSH server is configured to allow / support weak
  encryption algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The remote SSH server supports the following weak client-to-server encryption al!
gorithm(s):
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc
aes192-cbc
aes256-cbc
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc
The remote SSH server supports the following weak server-to-client encryption al!
gorithm(s):
3des-cbc
aes128-cbc
aes192-cbc
aes256-cbc
blowfish-cbc
cast128-cbc

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Disable the reported weak encryption algorithm(s).

Vulnerability Insight:
- The 'arcfour' cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit
  keys. The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCH!
NEIER]. Arcfour
  (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.
  - The 'none' algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that t!
his method provides
  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.
  - A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow a!
n attacker to
  recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks the supported encryption algorithms (client-to-server
  and server-to-client) of the remote SSH server.
  Currently weak encryption algorithms are defined as the following:
  - Arcfour (RC4) cipher based algorithms
  - none algorithm
  - CBC mode cipher based algorithms

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 1107937657
Packet 2: 1107938761

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

Threat: High (CVSS: 8.8)
Port:   10000/tcp

Summary:
Webmin is prone to a privilege escalation vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Installed version: 1.970
Fixed version:     1.994
Installation

NVT:    SSL/TLS: Renegotiation DoS Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1473, CVE-2011-5094)
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.117761
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.0)
Port:   10000/tcp

Summary:
The remote SSL/TLS service is prone to a denial of service (DoS)
  vulnerability.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following indicates that the remote SSL/TLS service is affected:
Protocol Version | Successful re-done SSL/TLS handshakes (Renegotiation) over an!
 existing / already established SSL/TLS connection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
--------------------------------------------------
TLSv1.2          | 10

Impact:
The flaw might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a
  DoS (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connec!
tion.

Solution:
Solution type: VendorFix
Users should contact their vendors for specific patch information.
  A general solution is to remove/disable renegotiation capabilities altogether !
from/in the affected
  SSL/TLS service.

Affected Software/OS:
Every SSL/TLS service which does not properly restrict
  client-initiated renegotiation.

Vulnerability Insight:
The flaw exists because the remote SSL/TLS service does not
  properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protoc!
ols.
  Note: The referenced CVEs are affecting OpenSSL and Mozilla Network Security S!
ervices (NSS) but
  both are in a DISPUTED state with the following rationale:
  > It can also be argued that it is the responsibility of server deployments, n!
ot a security
  library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a s!
pecific environment.
  Both CVEs are still kept in this VT as a reference to the origin of this flaw.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Checks if the remote service allows to re-do the same SSL/TLS
  handshake (Renegotiation) over an existing / already established SSL/TLS conne!
ction.

NVT:    Missing `httpOnly` Cookie Attribute
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105925
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 5.0)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
The application is missing the 'httpOnly' cookie attribute

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The cookies:
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=***replaced***; path=/
are missing the "httpOnly" attribute.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
Set the 'httpOnly' attribute for any session cookie.

Affected Software/OS:
Application with session handling in cookies.

Vulnerability Insight:
The flaw is due to a cookie is not using the 'httpOnly' attribute. This
  allows a cookie to be accessed by JavaScript which could lead to session hijac!
king attacks.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Check all cookies sent by the application for a missing 'httpOnly' attribute
Details:

NVT:    Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108440
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.8)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
The host / application transmits sensitive information (username, passwords) in
  cleartext via HTTP.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following input fields where identified (URL:input name):
http://10.0.0.26/admin.php:pass

Impact:
An attacker could use this situation to compromise or eavesdrop on the
  HTTP communication between the client and the server using a man-in-the-middle!
 attack to get access to
  sensitive data like usernames or passwords.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
Enforce the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.
  Additionally make sure the host / application is redirecting all users to the !
secured SSL/TLS connection before
  allowing to input sensitive data into the mentioned functions.

Affected Software/OS:
Hosts / applications which doesn't enforce the transmission of sensitive data vi!
a an
  encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Evaluate previous collected information and check if the host / application is n!
ot
  enforcing the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connecti!
on.
  The script is currently checking the following:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication (Basic Auth)
  - HTTP Forms (e.g. Login) with input field of type 'password'

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 2235052150
Packet 2: 2235053229

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

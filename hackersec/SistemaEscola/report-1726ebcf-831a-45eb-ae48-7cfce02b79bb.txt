Issue
-----
NVT:    Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.108440
Threat: Medium (CVSS: 4.8)
Port:   80/tcp

Summary:
The host / application transmits sensitive information (username, passwords) in
  cleartext via HTTP.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The following input fields where identified (URL:input name):
http://10.0.0.16/:pass
http://10.0.0.16/cadastra.php:pass

Impact:
An attacker could use this situation to compromise or eavesdrop on the
  HTTP communication between the client and the server using a man-in-the-middle!
 attack to get access to
  sensitive data like usernames or passwords.

Solution:
Solution type: Workaround
Enforce the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connection.
  Additionally make sure the host / application is redirecting all users to the !
secured SSL/TLS connection before
  allowing to input sensitive data into the mentioned functions.

Affected Software/OS:
Hosts / applications which doesn't enforce the transmission of sensitive data vi!
a an
  encrypted SSL/TLS connection.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Evaluate previous collected information and check if the host / application is n!
ot
  enforcing the transmission of sensitive data via an encrypted SSL/TLS connecti!
on.
  The script is currently checking the following:
  - HTTP Basic Authentication (Basic Auth)
  - HTTP Forms (e.g. Login) with input field of type 'password'

NVT:    TCP timestamps
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.80091
Threat: Low (CVSS: 2.6)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps and therefore allows to compute
  the uptime.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
It was detected that the host implements RFC1323/RFC7323.
The following timestamps were retrieved with a delay of 1 seconds in-between:
Packet 1: 3178321136
Packet 2: 3178322223

Impact:
A side effect of this feature is that the uptime of the remote
  host can sometimes be computed.

Solution:
Solution type: Mitigation
To disable TCP timestamps on linux add the line 'net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 0' to
  /etc/sysctl.conf. Execute 'sysctl -p' to apply the settings at runtime.
  To disable TCP timestamps on Windows execute 'netsh int tcp set global timesta!
mps=disabled'
  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be complete!
ly disabled.
  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP pee!
r
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segm!
ent.
  See the references for more information.

Affected Software/OS:
TCP implementations that implement RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Insight:
The remote host implements TCP timestamps, as defined by RFC1323/RFC7323.

Vulnerability Detection Method:
Special IP packets are forged and sent with a little delay in between to the
  target IP. The responses are searched for a timestamps. If found, the timestam!
ps are reported.

NVT:    OS Detection Consolidation and Reporting
OID:    1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.105937
Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
This script consolidates the OS information detected by several
  VTs and tries to find the best matching OS.
  Furthermore it reports all previously collected information leading to this be!
st matching OS. It
  also reports possible additional information which might help to improve the O!

Threat: Log (CVSS: 0.0)
Port:   general/tcp

Summary:
Collect information about the network route and
  network distance between the scanner host and the target host.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
Network route from scanner (172.30.3.226) to target (10.0.0.16):
172.30.3.226
10.0.0.16
Network distance between scanner and target: 2

Solution:

Vulnerability Insight:
For internal networks, the distances are usually
  small, often less than 4 hosts between scanner and target. For public targets !
the
  distance is greater and might be 10 hosts or more.

Log Method:
A combination of the protocols ICMP and TCP is used
  to determine the route. This method is applicable for IPv4 only and it is also!
 known as
  'traceroute'.

Vulnerability Detection Result:
The Hostname/IP "10.0.0.16" was used to access the remote host.
Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the "Enable gener!
